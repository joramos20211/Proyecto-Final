What I learned in ¡Supérate! about Informatics assignment

By: Milen Julio Senior PM

Well, I have to remember my first year in Supérate, my computer knowledge was little at that time, but when I started in Supérate, I learned some things as well as any computer function, I learned some things about Excel in my first year the basics. After that we were doing animation, Photoshop, and finally we started with programming with Python which was difficult for me since it was the first time I was doing it, it was a year full of new experiences and knowledge. 

Moving on to my second year, well that was a year full of challenges, starting because I had to decide for one of the three routes that in the end I chose BackEnd I had no specific reason to choose that route because if it was about knowledge I had to choose data analysis because I already knew its language but I was not comfortable with that programming language and I also wanted to change and learn something new and to this day I don't regret my decision but that was not all that year, thanks to the pandemic and the confinement I had to get used to search and understand by myself because I didn't have a teacher in front of me explaining me every step. That year I learned a new programming language which was HTML and then HTML mixed with JavaScript I felt a little lost at first but then I got used to it and in the end, I really liked that kind of language because it didn't feel so complicated after knowing what was the structure, the commands, and everything else . It was a difficult year but not impossible. 

To finish in my third year I learned more in depth what Excel was from the appearance of the page, making graphs, all kinds of operations, sorting data . I admit it was not easy but in the end every effort has a reward and it was for me because I passed my Excel certification with the score that I had not stipulated. On the other hand this year I also learned what was more in depth I feel the domain of JavaScript that I did not know how to create objects, move from .ts to .js and thanks to all those explanations and practices I have a result that I passed my MTA certification (Microsoft Technology Associate). I also learned Angular although I don't fully master it but I know the basics. 

As a conclusion of these three years, I take with me not only the two certifications but a lot of knowledge that I know will serve me at some point in the future and experiences like when you set a problem and when you execute it you get it perfectly or as you wanted, it is a feeling of satisfaction that I will not forget because in those small moments you can realize that all your time and effort you have put into it has been worth it. I won't put them into practice when I get out of the supérate but I will keep them in mind.

Although computer science was not a field that interested me or attracted my attention, during these years of apprenticeship, I have learned to love it thanks to the ample opportunities it offers us. Three years of learning are responsible for my change of perspective. But what learning? You want to know, don't you, read on and you'll find out. 


The first year was the most adaptable to the subjects we taught, including PowerPoint, Word and Excel. Of the first two I had basic knowledge that allowed me to defend myself, of the third one I knew nothing, it was the least important and interesting for me. I had never given myself the opportunity to explore it, but I was convinced that I didn't like it. The first 2 quarters were focused on that, in excel area learning the menu, the basic functions, adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, taking the minimum, maximum, average, inserting, adding, deleting, columns and rows, incrementing and decrementing decimals, etc. In Word, insert images, edit them, delete background, change color, outline, effect. Edit texts, protect our files, set security pins, change properties, add and delete authors, change interface language, correct grammatical errors, auto save the document, recover it in case of loss, etc. On the other hand, in PowerPoint -my favorite- we made use of the tools it offered us to bring our imagination to reality and capture it on the slide. We learned how to make transitions to change pages with more color and movement, animations to give life to our texts, images, objects, etc., allowing us to establish a sequence creating a chronological effect. The third quarter took a turn and Microsoft office applications were left aside, and we entered a totally different world, or so I said; programming <the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it in a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer.> The detestation of Excel was dwarfed by this new subject. Basically, we dedicated ourselves to research, watching videos to soak up the subject, and when it came time to put the knowledge into practice, it made sense to program. 


The second year was the craziest year of this 3 year adventure called "Superate! The pandemic came to stay, altering all plans, changing the order and imposing a new one. That's why we had to go to remote classes from home. And as expected the first quarter was based on my dear and beloved friend, programming who also came to stay and change things, arriving with new challenges, mechanisms, commands, variables, showing its wide range of languages, making me take one of its 3 routes, Backend, Frontend and Data Analysis. Of which I chose the first one, Back-end. In this route we work mostly on what the client does not see, but it is what makes possible the result that is obtained. For that we work with JavaScript, which is an interpreted programming language, defined as object-oriented, adding dynamism to our web pages. That's what the second year was based on, learning as much as possible about JavaScript, we did several projects, a calculator, a converter of measurements from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and vice versa. I learned about commands, how to create variables, mathematical functions, how to insert links into my code, how to insert HTML code into JavaScript, among others. Very good knowledge. 


Third and last year, this year had very important dates, and because of them we went from giving programming to retaking Excel, since of the two important dates, this was the first one. The teaching dynamics was focused on what we would see in the certification. Topics such as creating charts, modifying them, deleting columns, rows, cells. Eliminating duplicates. Editing images, adding effects to them. Converting a table into a range. Averaging table data, setting frequencies, creating mini charts. Change the color scale of graphs and tables. Many of these things we had already done, however, we learned to perform the same task with different techniques or methods. We did several simulators before the test so we could familiarize ourselves with the interface, it was super helpful. With that I learned to work efficiently developing the assigned tasks within the time we were given. 


After the certification we went back to programming, since now it was time to get certified in that. For this preparation we continued using JavaScript as our path language. We did a review of variables, functions, objects, the language's own terms, among others. And we relied heavily on the use of problems and questions to encourage logic, as it is very important to develop the test. 

Currently we continue to see programming, now working with external apps, such as git, Angular, others. We learned to use the CMD, the Command prompt of the computer to go into the folder of our choice, download problems from there, run them and delete files. From Angular we are learning to create projects in TypeScript, which then using some commands compile to JavaScript, HTML and Json. We are also using Git to create a repertoire, which will be able to make changes and allow us to use them in the version we have modified.

In these three years that we have been learning in Superate. We have learned various topics in computer science both theoretical and practical as well as technical such as: Excel, Word, how to write codes faster, among others. Excel is very useful for everyone and almost all companies, Word on the other hand is one of the most used tools for both workers and students, in the following ways: reports, writing, resume, college or school assignments. We also have knowledge of power point.

Nowadays with only basic computer skills you can work as a computer technician... And if we who have more knowledge than the basics is not very helpful both for personal projects and work and projects for a company.
Code: such as Python, HTML, JavaScript.
For example, if in the future I want to work in a company where they need someone who knows about: HTML, I can use it in the following ways.
Web pages’ development.
Web document Creation.
Responsive images on web pages.
Offline capabilities usage.
Data Entry support with HTML
